## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox


### Continued development

From this project and on, I will continue to learn more about media queries and do my best to make every website correctly addapt to every screen size. Because, even though is responsive enough, there's still a lot to fix.

### Useful resources

- [MDN Web Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/es/docs/Web/CSS/Media_Queries/Using_media_queries) - I was getting kind of stuck with media queries and this really cleared my mind when trying to make the design a little responsive.
